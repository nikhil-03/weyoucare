  <h1 class="blog-h1" data-aos="slide-up">What is a coronavirus?</h1>
  <p class="blog-para" data-aos="slide-up">Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans.  In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19.</p>
  <hr class="blog-hr">
  <h1 class="blog-h1" data-aos="slide-up">What is COVID-19?</h1>
  <p class="blog-para" data-aos="slide-up">
    COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. COVID-19 is now a pandemic affecting many countries globally.</p>
    <hr class="blog-hr">    
  <h1 class="blog-h1" data-aos="slide-up">What should I do if I have COVID-19 symptoms and when should I seek medical care?</h1>
  <p class="blog-para" data-aos="slide-up">
    If you have minor symptoms, such as a slight cough or a mild fever, there is generally no need to seek medical care. Stay at home, self-isolate and monitor your symptoms. Follow national guidance on self-isolation.
    
    However, if you live in an area with malaria or dengue fever it is important that you do not ignore symptoms of fever.  Seek medical help.  When you attend the health facility wear a mask if possible, keep at least 1 metre distance from other people and do not touch surfaces with your hands. If it is a child who is sick help the child stick to this advice.
    
    Seek immediate medical care if you have difficulty breathing or pain/pressure in the chest. If possible, call your health care provider in advance, so he/she can direct you to the right health facility.</p>

  <h1 class="blog-h1" data-aos="slide-up">How does COVID-19 spread?</h1>
  <p class="blog-para" data-aos="slide-up">
    People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease spreads primarily from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth, which are expelled when a person with COVID-19 coughs, sneezes, or speaks. These droplets are relatively heavy, do not travel far and quickly sink to the ground. People can catch COVID-19 if they breathe in these droplets from a person infected with the virus.  This is why it is important to stay at least 1 meter) away from others. These droplets can land on objects and surfaces around the person such as tables, doorknobs and handrails.  People can become infected by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.  This is why it is important to wash your hands regularly with soap and water or clean with alcohol-based hand rub.
    
    WHO is assessing ongoing research on the ways that COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share updated findings. </p>

  <h1 class="blog-h1" data-aos="slide-up">What should I do if I have come in close contact with someone who has COVID-19?</h1>
  <p class="blog-para" data-aos="slide-up">
    If you have been in close contact with someone with COVID-19, you may be infected.
    
    Close contact means that you live with or have been in settings of less than 1 metre from those who have the disease. In these cases, it is best to stay at home.
    
    However, if you live in an area with malaria or dengue fever it is important that you do not ignore symptoms of fever. Seek medical help. When you attend the health facility wear a mask if possible, keep at least 1 metre distant from other people and do not touch surfaces with your hands. If it is a child who is sick help the child stick to this advice.
    
    If you do not live in an area with malaria or dengue fever please do the following:
    
    If you become ill, even with very mild symptoms you must self-isolate
    Even if you don’t think you have been exposed to COVID-19 but develop symptoms, then self-isolate and monitor yourself
    You are more likely to infect others in the early stages of the disease when you just have mild symptoms, therefore early self-isolation is very important.
    If you do not have symptoms, but have been exposed to an infected person, self-quarantine for 14 days.
    If you have definitely had COVID-19 (confirmed by a test) self-isolate for 14 days even after symptoms have disappeared as a precautionary measure – it is not yet known exactly how long people remain infectious after they have recovered. Follow national advice on self-isolation.</p>
  <hr class="blog-hr">
  <h1 class="blog-h1" data-aos="slide-up">How can we protect others and ourselves if we don't know who is infected?</h1>
  <p class="blog-para" data-aos="slide-up">How can we protect others and ourselves if we don't know who is infected?
    Practicing hand and respiratory hygiene is important at ALL times and is the best way to protect others and yourself.
    
    When possible maintain at least a 1 meter distance between yourself and others. This is especially important if you are standing by someone who is coughing or sneezing.  Since some infected persons may not yet be exhibiting symptoms or their symptoms may be mild, maintaining a physical distance with everyone is a good idea if you are in an area where COVID-19 is circulating. </p>
  <hr class="blog-hr">
  <h1 class="blog-h1" data-aos="slide-up">Can children or adolescents catch COVID-19?</h1>
  <p class="blog-para" data-aos="slide-up">
    Research indicates that children and adolescents are just as likely to become infected as any other age group and can spread the disease.
    
    Evidence to date suggests that children and young adults are less likely to get severe disease, but severe cases can still happen in these age groups.
    
    Children and adults should follow the same guidance on self-quarantine and self-isolation if there is a risk they have been exposed or are showing symptoms. It is particularly important that children avoid contact with older people and others who are at risk of more severe disease.</p>
  <hr class="blog-hr">
  <h1 class="blog-h1" data-aos="slide-up">How to grocery shop safely?</h1>
  <p class="blog-para" data-aos="slide-up">
    When grocery shopping, keep at least 1-metre distance from others and avoid touching your eyes, mouth and nose. If possible, sanitize the handles of shopping trolleys or baskets before shopping. Once home, wash your hands thoroughly and also after handling and storing your purchased products.
    
    There is currently no confirmed case of COVID-19 transmitted through food or food packaging.</p>
  <hr class="blog-hr">
  <h1 class="blog-h1" data-aos="slide-up">How to wash fruits and vegetables?</h1>
  <p class="blog-para" data-aos="slide-up">
    Fruits and vegetables are important components of a healthy diet. Wash them the same way you should do under any circumstance: before handling them, wash your hands with soap and water. Then, wash fruits and vegetables thoroughly with clean water, especially if you eat them raw.</p>
  <hr class="blog-hr">
  <h1 class="blog-h1" data-aos="slide-up">Can I catch COVID-19 from the faeces of someone with the disease?</h1>
  <p class="blog-para" data-aos="slide-up">
    While initial investigations suggest the virus may be present in faeces in some cases, to date, there have not been reports of faecal-oral transmission of COVID-19. Additionally, there is no evidence to date on the survival of the COVID-19 virus in water or sewage.
    
    WHO is assessing ongoing research on the ways COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share new findings on this topic.</p>
